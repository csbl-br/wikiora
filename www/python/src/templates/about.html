  <p class="mt-2 text-center small text-muted">WikiORA integrates Wikidata, Gene Ontology, PanglaoDB, and Wikipedia
    for simple, encyclopedic enrichment analysis.</p>
  <p>WikiORA is a tool designed to simplify the process of gene set over-representation analysis by integrating data
    from Wikidata and Wikipedia. Our aim is to provide an easy-to-use platform for researchers to identify significantly
    enriched gene sets in their data, using a combination of curated gene sets from various sources.</p>

  <h3>How It Works</h3>
  <p>WikiORA uses the following steps to perform over-representation analysis:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>A list of genes is provided by the user.</li>
    <li>The background gene sets are defined using data curated into Wikidata.</li>
    <li>For each gene set, the overlap between the user-provided gene list and the genes associated with the gene set
      (and its Wikipedia page) is calculated.</li>
    <li>The p-value is calculated using the hypergeometric test, representing the probability of observing at least as
      many overlapping genes by chance.</li>
    <li>The Benjamini-Hochberg correction</a> is applied to account for multiple testing and
      adjust the p-values.</li>
    <li>The odds ratio (provided in the download file) is calculated as follows: oddsRatio = (1.0 * a * d) /
      Math.max(1.0 * b * c, 1).</li>
    <li>The combined score (provided in the download file) is calculated as follows: combinedScore = -log(p) *
      oddsRatio.</li>
    <li>Results are sorted by p-value to highlight the most significantly over-represented terms.</li>
  </ol>
  <li>Results are sorted by p-value to highlight the most significantly over-represented terms.</li>
  </ol>
